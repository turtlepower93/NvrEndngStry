# What is it?

NvrEndngStry is an app that allows users to come together to create a story. In some circles it's called Pass the Story

After you login, you are able to create a new book, or edit an existing story

In the new book page, you are able to create a new story. This is done by inputting the title and the genre. Once you've done that, hit the submit button.

Now that you've started a story, let's get to writing!

From the Library page, click on the name of one of the stories. This will open the story page!

From here, you can add a sentence to the story by inputing text just under the title. Once you hit "Scribe", you will have added a sentence to the story which will appear immediately below.

You can also add comments! This allows the writers to collaborate if they wish to do so.

# Next Steps

* Make some way of allowing users to see who posted what sentence. (maybe hovering over displays name or adding color that corresponds with user.)

* Right now user's aren't restricted in their input. Make character limits for all inputs dependent on what they are.

* User's can also post sentences one after the other. In this game, users are supposed to be blocked from adding two sentences in a row. Add this!

* Media querys galore to make the site usable on mobile and tablets

* The CSS is a bit messy. brush up on naming conventions and organize the style file.

* Add animations to make the site more exciting.

* Add an admin profile that has delete privledges
